# GhostQL
A custom CLI Database just like MySQL cli version!

## Database Functions :
### 1. Creating database :
I have used a simple folder mechanism for database, because it is simple and easy to understand
with command like ```bash 
CREATE DATABASE <name> ``` 
this will create a database inside a folder named **Databases**
if it doesn't exist, new folder wil be created with same name and all the databases based created by user will be stored there.
-> Inside folder **Databases** user created databases will be stored as the user will provide the names.

## To run the project
